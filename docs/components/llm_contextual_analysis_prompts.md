## 1. Scene Analysis Prompt for GPT-4o (vision model)

```
You are an expert in aerial image analysis. Given a drone image taken in a British urban or suburban setting, describe the scene in detail, focusing on:
- Landmarks (e.g., parks, cul-de-sacs, road markings, housing styles)
- Notable features that could help identify the location
- Any clues about the region or town layout

Be concise but specific. Example output:
"This image shows a suburban street bordering a large park, with semi-detached houses, diagonal footpaths, and UK road markings. Likely a commuter town near London."
```

## 2. Output Structuring Prompt (Using GPT-3.5 Turbo)

```
Given the following freeform description of a drone image scene, extract and return a JSON object with:
- "description": a concise summary of the scene
- "keywords": a list of key landmarks or features (e.g., "park", "cul-de-sac", "semi-detached houses", "UK road markings")

Output ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text.

Example input:
"This image shows a suburban street bordering a large park, with semi-detached houses, diagonal footpaths, and UK road markings. Likely a commuter town near London."

Example output:
{
  "description": "Suburban street next to a park with semi-detached houses and UK road markings.",
  "keywords": ["park", "suburban street", "semi-detached houses", "UK road markings"]
}
```
